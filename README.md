# TRoS Referee

A handy utility for tabletop gaming

## What is this?

TRoS Referee was conceived as a useful tool for players of
Driftwood Publishing's tabletop role playing game, The Riddle
of Steel. The application handles complex die rolls within the
game and provides damage table entries with a clean and simple
GUI.

It's implemented in Java SE 6, using the Swing framework.

## Why is this?

TRoS's combat system, while gruesomely realistic and pleasantly
strategic, is extremely cumbersome. Players regularly have to 
roll fistfuls of 10-sided dice (the game recommends using a 
bowl), tallying up results, and consulting various lengthy 
charts. Needless to say, some players find this daunting. Even
those who don't can be frustrated by how slowly combat moves.

I wanted to make a tool that could handle the damage tables and
dice rolling, speeding up combat turns substantially without
removing player agency. 

## Is it finished?

No. The GUI is passable, and the application runs with no hiccups,
but I never finished transcribing the damage tables. Moreover, 
there are many improvements that I'd like to make now that I look
back on it a year later.

I won't be touching it for the foreseeable future, but the code is
here for anyone who'd like to improve it or implement their own
version (e.g. for TRoS' spiritual successor: Blade of the Iron
Throne).
